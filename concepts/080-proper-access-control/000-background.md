When your site [lacks access control](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A7-Missing_Function_Level_Access_Control), it means that users can take actions that they should not be allowed to take. For example, if on Facebook it were possible for any user to update my status, this would be an example of a missing access control.

The frontend of *Auther* currently implies that certain users are able to take certain actions and others are not. Through its UI it further implies what actions *no user may take*.
