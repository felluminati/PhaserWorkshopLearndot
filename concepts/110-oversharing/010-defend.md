The "attack" here is pretty straightforward. In a web browser, you can visit `http://localhost:8080/api/users/` or `http://localhost:8080/api/users/4` (or any other id) and very clearly see passwords! (And also emails and phone numbers.)

To defend, make it so that *no* users (not even admins) can retrieve any user's password (not even their own).
