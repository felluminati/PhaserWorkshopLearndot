At the heart of software security is ultimately data security. OWASP lists [sensitive data exposure](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A6-Sensitive_Data_Exposure) 6th on its top 10 list.

Perhaps the silliest way this can occur is by accidentally *oversharing* informationâ€”this is an easy default to slip into. With any data stored in our database, it's important to determine not only *resource-and-method-level* access for different users (i.e. "proper access control" from earlier) but also fine-grained access control for each field.
