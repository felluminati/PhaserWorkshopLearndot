There are a number of ways to have basic [security misconfiguration](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A5-Security_Misconfiguration). In general, these involve accidentally sticking with the defaults of your system, or overlooking some interaction between the various technologies and environments involved in making your app do what it does.

Which is pretty vague. For this particular exercise, we will be focusing on one such misconfiguration: accidental exposure of *application secrets*. Application secrets are *not* the same as user secrets. Which is still pretty vague :)
