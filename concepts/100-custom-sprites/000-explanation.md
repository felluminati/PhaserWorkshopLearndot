There's a number of tools out there for making your own 2D sprites. We recommend a free online editor called [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/).

* Sign up for a free an account
* Set your canvas size to 32 x 32 pixels or 64 x 64
* Draw a basic character
* Export as a png spritesheet with 1 row

Now let's animate our drawing!

* Duplicate our character to generate another frame
* Alter the frame
* Do this for a few more frames
* View the animated sprite in the top-right animation preview window
* Export the animation spritesheet as a png
