Phaser is a popular Javascript game engine primarily used for making cool 2D games that can be played right in the browser! Phaser 3 is the most recent version and was officially released Feb 2018, so it's still new and actively being developed. That being said, please note that Phaser 2 and Phaser 3 are not compatible (even though they their APIs have a lot in common), so just be aware when you're googling for help that the majority of tutorials and code snippets online are still for Phaser 2.

Since we've spent this long learning and (hopefully) mastering JavaScript, we'll use Phaser's game engine that allows us to keep working in familiar territory! Beware, however, that's where the familiarity ends!
