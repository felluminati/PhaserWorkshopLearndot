- [OAuth](http://blog.varonis.com/introduction-to-oauth/)
- [Encryption](https://medium.com/@vrypan/explaining-public-key-cryptography-to-non-geeks-f0994b3c2d5)
- [Hashing and salting](https://crackstation.net/hashing-security.htm)

You should also understand some common attacks, and standard defensive strategies to thwart such attacks. In particular, you should grasp how to:

- Protect your application secrets
- Prevent injection and cross-site scripting attacks
- Implement proper access control
- Configure an HTTPS server
- Verify a user's identity properly, without allowing for any gaps
- Securely store users' passwords in your database

Of course, there is a lot more you could learn about web security. We encourage you to probe its depths.
