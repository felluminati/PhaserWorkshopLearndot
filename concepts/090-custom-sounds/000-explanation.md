You've been using premade assets up until this point. But you know what? All those assets didn't exist until someone created them. And it's easier than you think!

Don't underestimate your ability to make cool sounds quickly. There are programs that help you generate high-quality sound effects with a single click. At the very least, you can always just make weird noises with your mouth and record them.

Here's a list of programs you should check out:

* Audacity -- Free, open-source software for recording and editing audio. (Windows, Linux, Mac)
