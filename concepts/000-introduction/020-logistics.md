You and your partner are [a team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A-Team). We recommend the "Forking Workflow" for sharing your source code with each other. Read more about that workflow [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#forking-workflow).

Defense Against the Dark Arts is a multi-round game of security. Really it is like a bunch of mini-workshops back-to-back.

You will play a number of rounds, each with three phases: instruction (with attack demo), defense discovery, and defense review. You will be playing against "the house"â€”your existing application is insecure and you're trying to defend it against the attack demos.

You can gain points for implementing adequate defensive maneuvers. Whoever gets the most points wins...absolutely nothing! So have fun either way :)

Each round, each phase will have an allotted time.

## Phase 1: Instruction

A specific attack pattern / security concern will be presented to the class, and you will have time to ask the instructor any questions. We will cover a set of particular attacks on the existing Auther codebase.

## Phase 2: Defense Discovery

Now that you understand how to take advantage of the given security flaw, your job during this phase is to take *your own* application and attempt to defend against these attacks. You will be given an outline of possible attacks and you can score points for defending against each one.

## Phase 3: Defense Review

Finally, we will come together again to review possible defense solutions and go over questions. After this phase there will often be a short break before the next round's phase 1 begins.
