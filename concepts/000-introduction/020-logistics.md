Let's checkout the codebase.

## Phase 1: Instruction

A specific attack pattern / security concern will be presented to the class, and you will have time to ask the instructor any questions. We will cover a set of particular attacks on the existing Auther codebase.

## Phase 2: Defense Discovery

Now that you understand how to take advantage of the given security flaw, your job during this phase is to take *your own* application and attempt to defend against these attacks. You will be given an outline of possible attacks and you can score points for defending against each one.

## Phase 3: Defense Review

Finally, we will come together again to review possible defense solutions and go over questions. After this phase there will often be a short break before the next round's phase 1 begins.
