The starting point for this workshop can be found [here](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/auther-dada). Fork this repo and then clone it locally.

In this workshop, we will be creating a very simple 2D shooting game called Full Blast Academy. It's meant to get you up and running with Phaser quickly and introduce you to basic game concepts such as: moving and animating sprites, handling collisions between objects, and adding sound effects. Hopefully it'll inspire you to create your own unique game!

Once you have it cloned be sure to run npm install. Then, try running npm start, the script located in the package.json file. This script will build the webpack bundle for you and spin up a dev server to host our game. You should be able to go to localhost: 8080 and checkout your game!

<hint title="Scorecard: what do you see?">
Total darkness!
Not very exciting. Yet!
Go ahead and open your dev tools and in the console you should see Phaser has started up it's client!
