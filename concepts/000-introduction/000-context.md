The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) has catalogued its take on the [top 10 web security vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-Top_10), "selected and prioritized according to [prevalence], exploitability, detectability, and impact estimates". There will be 5 exercises that span 6 vulnerabilities from OWASP's list. The 2017 list came out but was [rejected](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Top_Ten_Project#tab=OWASP_Top_10_for_2017_Release_Candidate_1).

Our starting point in this workshop is a seemingly complete *Auther* application. Yet beneath its sexy veneer is a sinister truth: the application is outrageously insecure. You're about to fix that.

Security on the web is subtle and complicated. The exercises you're about to go through should push your understanding of full stack web applications. By the end, you should have a good grounding in the common attacks, and more importantly you should be prepared to defend against them.
