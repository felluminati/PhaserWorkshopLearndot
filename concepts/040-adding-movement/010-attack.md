As always, setup the vulnerable app (provided by your instructor):

1. Re-seed the database
2. Start the server

Here's what you-as-the-attacker can do:
- Make requests to the server as any ordinary client might. Through a browser, curl, and/or postman if you wish. You may use the provided logins for an ordinary user and an admin user.

With only this capability, you will gain a point for executing arbitrary JavaScript on the defending server, e.g. `console.log('gotcha')`. Gain an additional point if you manage to `console.log` a funny joke. As in, for every person you find who agrees (under no duress) that the joke is funny, gain one point.

**Only continue onwards once the attack phase is officially over (the next step contains spoilers), unless of course you're an anarchist or someone who likes spoilers.**
