During this phase, defend your own application. At the end, gain a point for every secret you are sure could not be accessed by a would-be attacker. This hypothetical attacker has the same capabilities you just had last phase. They can look at the your GitHub repo (which must be up-to-date) and/or make requests as a client to your running server.

Of course, your application must also still function. Gain no points if your app has lost any features or capabilities (e.g. if users are no longer able to sign in via google). Or if you simply failed to make any changes whatsoever to your codebase, lose one point (unless you're feeling really bummed about that fact, in which case *go talk to an instructor or fellowâ€”why are you bothering with this meaningless point system anyways*).
