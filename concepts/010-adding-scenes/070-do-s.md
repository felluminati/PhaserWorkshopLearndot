## Background
A [denial of service (DoS) attack](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denial_of_Service) seeks to bring down an application or one of its services. Commonly this entails flooding a server with more requests than it can handle. A distributed denail of service (DDoS) is a particular kind of DoS attack that involves many clients colludingâ€”voluntarily or otherwise. Today we'll be focusing on a volume-based single-node attacker.

## Rules of Engagement
Attackers may operate from the client side only, though may freely run any client side scripts. Attackers gain a point if they manage to keep a "legitimate user" (which will simply be a *different* client not participating in the DoS) from loading any state within less than 10 seconds.
