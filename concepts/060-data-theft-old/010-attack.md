Using the vulnerable app (provided by your instructor):

1. Re-seed the database
2. Start the server

Here's what you-as-the-attacker can do:

- Make requests to the server as any ordinary client might. Through a browser, curl, and/or postman if you wish. You may use the provided logins for an ordinary user and an admin user.

Each of the following is worth one point:

- Log in as any user simply by knowing their email.
- Create a new admin user whose email and password are known to you.
- Discover the password of a user when logged in as a different (non-admin) user.
- Discover any user's OAuth token when logged in as a different (non-admin) user.

**Don't continue unless yada-yada-yada, pain of death, blah blah blah, you get the idea.**
